# PCI SSC FAQ Scraper

This is a quick Python script that scrapes the PCI SSC's website for FAQ article numbers, creation dates, titles, and corresponding links. Their site doesn't include an index that allows you to view all the FAQ titles in one place (which can be helpful when quickly searching for information on a topic) so I built this.

[results.csv](https://github.com/null-route/PCI-SSC-FAQ-Scraper/blob/master/results.csv) includes the results of the script as of 07/03/2017.

Inspired by [Rob Chahin](https://github.com/robchahin)'s previous scraper.
